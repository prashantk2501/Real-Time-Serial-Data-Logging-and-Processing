# Real-Time-Serial-Data-Logging-and-Processing
A lightweight, cross-platform desktop application that turns any serial stream—for example an ESP32 or Arduino—into a live oscilloscope, XY tracker and data logger. It is written in Python 3.9 + PySide6 + pyqtgraph (no C-extensions, installs with pip).
